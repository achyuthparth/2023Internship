There are N agents M customers.
Suppose we cluster the customers by proximity to the nearest agent to create N clusters.
> How do I prove that clustering by proximity will make the travel time the least?
If there are 3 stops, and the distance between the first two is lesser than the distance between the second two, then the travel between the second and third stop will be shorter.
Assume this is true for k stops.
If there are k, of which


Suppose that there exists an algorithm which will optimize the travel path within a cluster.
