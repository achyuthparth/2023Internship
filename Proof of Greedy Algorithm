There are N agents M customers.
Suppose we cluster the customers by proximity to the nearest agent to create N clusters.

Suppose that there exists an algorithm which will optimize the travel path within a cluster.

Since the travel time is dependent on the distance between stops, we can assume that the total cost of travel is minimized.

Assume proximity clustering will lead to least travel time for agent.
